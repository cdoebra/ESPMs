# ESPMs: evolution-strengthened prognostic models

## **Introduction**
The dataset used in this paper and the code to build the model are uploaded here.

*`Evolution information`*: Ohnologs list and evolutionary stages of human genes

*`Input features`*: Input features of neural networks

*`RNA-seq`*: RNA-seq and clinical data for the TCGA and GEO cancer cohorts

*`Survival genes`*: Results of survival analysis for each cancer and significant survival-related genes

*`code`*: The code for the methods and models used in this research. Detailed comments and parameters are labeled in every code file
